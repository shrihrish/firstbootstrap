     <p>SaaS providers offer these cloud servers and their associated 
resources via dashboard and/or API. IaaS clients have direct access to 
their servers and storage, just as they would with traditional servers 
but gain access to a much higher order of scalability. Users of IaaS can
 outsource and build a “virtual data center” in the cloud and have 
access to many of the same technologies and resource capabilities of a 
traditional data center without having to invest in capacity planning or
 the physical maintenance and management of it..</p>

    <h2>Platform</h2>
    <img src="index_files/platform.png" alt="platform" style="width: 100%">
    <p>PaaS providers abstract much of the work of dealing with servers 
and give clients an environment in which the operating system and server
 software, as well as the underlying server hardware and network 
infrastructure are taken care of, leaving users free to focus on the 
business side of scalability, and the application development of their 
product or service.</p>

        <h2>Softwares</h2>
        <img src="index_files/software.jpeg" alt="softwares" stytle="width:100%">
        <p>SaaS is very similar to the old thin-client model of software
 provision, where clients, in this case usually web browsers, provide 
the point of access to software running on servers. SaaS is the most 
familiar form of cloud service for consumers. SaaS moves the task of 
managing software and its deployment to third-party services. Among the 
most familiar SaaS applications for business are customer relationship 
management applications like Salesforce, productivity software suites 
like Google Apps, and storage solutions brothers like Box and Dropbox.</p>
